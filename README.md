# Phase 5 Full-stack application - Team Manager

## Description

Team manager is a fullstack application that displays profiles, teams, and leagues from a generated database. When you load this application you're introduced to a login page where you can choose to either log in to an existing user or sign up as a new user. The logged in user is then able to see cards of players, teams, and leagues from the generated base. The user also has the ability to edit their profile, log out of their account, and delete their account.

## Getting started

Fork and clone this repository then cd into the project. Once you are in the project we will need to run two terminals, one for the front-end part of the application and another for the back end side. In the front-end terminal enter this line `npm start --prefix client`. You should see a browser open up with the the title "Team manager". In the back-end enter this line `cd server` then in a new line enter `python app.py`. With these done you are able to explore the application.
